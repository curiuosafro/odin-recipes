          <h2> <em>DO YOU DRINK?</em></h2>
          <p> I used to hate the taste of alchol, in-fact I still do. 
              <p>I wanted to taste that German beer!</p>
              <p>I wanted to taste that Russian Vodka!</p>
              <p>Most of all I wanted to taste that American Burbon!</p>
              <p>My favorite drink to make is the MassCow Mule</p>
              <p>It's simple and elegant for those of us who have a strong distrust for jack & coke!</p>
          </p>

          <h3> What do you need to make it?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A full can of Ginger Beer</li>
                    <li> Two or three or Four Shots of Vodka: <em>I don't judge if you choose to add in a fifth shot</em></li>
                    <li> Crushed ice:<em>I like mine with crushed ice, like my crushed dreams</em></li>
                    <li> Freshly squeezed lime-juice</li>
                    <li> Grounded mint: <em> Keep this to a minimum</em></li>
                </ul>

         <h4> "How do I make it?" You ask</h4> 
            <ol>
                <li> Grind the ice if you don have a fancy fridge, put it back in the fridge if you don't have everything else ready.</li>
                <li> Grind the mint, put it in the firdge until you have everything else ready</li>
                <li> Squeeze your lime and make some lime juice, none of that store bought crap</li>
                <li> Add your crushed ice to the glass with ground mint</li>
                <li> Add generous shots of Vodka to the glass </li>
                <li> Add your lime-juice and ginger beer</li>
                <li> Stir to mix and serve those ungrateful people</li> 
            </ol>
