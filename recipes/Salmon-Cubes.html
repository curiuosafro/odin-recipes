          <h2>When I was younger...</h2>
          <p> I used to climb trees and eat mangos. As I grew I feared climbing trees and rarely ate mangos.
              I used to do without thinking and now I think before I do.
              The curse of self-actualization could never be a blessing to a free thinker.
              Fish doesn't think or so we tell ourselves. I eat salmon becuase some tiktok lady made it look delicous.
              Salmon cubes are the best way to enjoy salmon, espcially if you have an air fryer. 
              Enjoy!
          </p>
